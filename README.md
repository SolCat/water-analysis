# Water-Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project examines nearly 100 types of water, analyzing 12 qualitative and quantitative variables, including ionic composition, sodium levels, and hydrogen potential. The dataset is explored using univariate, bivariate, and multidimensional techniques.

## **Data & Statistics**
The dataset includes 95 types of water, described by **12 qualitative** (name, nature, country) and **quantitative** (ionic composition, sodium, etc.) **variables**.

## **Methodology**
**PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is used to explore multivariate observations, revealing patterns of similarity and dissimilarity and offering a synthetic, global view of the data.

## **Outcomes**
The Principal Component Analyses (PCA) revealed groups of variables indicating similar behaviors, such as the relationship between pH and NO3, where lower pH (acidic) correlates with higher NO3 concentrations. PCA also helped group waters with common characteristics, such as Talians, HÃ©par, Courmayeur, and Contrex, which are rich in calcium and magnesium. This typology is useful in health contexts, where water consumption varies by age and condition. However, data quality, particularly missing or extreme values, can affect the analysis, making data preprocessing crucial.
